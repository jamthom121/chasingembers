Lyrics for "The Underground" by Meg Myes


Fake it, make it, I can't breathe
Beautiful lover, leave me be
I'm better off on my own

It's too much baby I can't take it
So give my love to the broken hearted
They never have and they never will
All I want is to be happy
But what is happy

Looking up at the fallen stars
In a black sky you don't know where you are
Give me space, give me no more sound
Give my regards from the underground
Give my regards from the underground

Hide me in the forest green
Don't want no part of your hipster scene
I'd rather die, be buried alive
All I want is to be happy
But what is happy

Looking up at the fallen stars
In a black sky you don't know where you are
Give me space, give me no more sound
Give my regards from the underground

Give my regards from the underground

I know when it starts to hurt
I can run, run away
Through the back roads and the highways

Looking up at the fallen stars
In a black sky you don't know where you are
Give me space, give me no more sound
Give my regards from the underground

Think I'll have another breakdown
I'll have another breakdown
I'll have another breakdown
Give my regards from the underground
Think I'll have another breakdown
I'll have another breakdown
Think I'll have another breakdown
Give my regards from the underground
