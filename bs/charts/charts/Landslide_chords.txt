[Intro]
| C G/B | Am7 G/B |
| C G/B | Am7 G/B |
 
[Verse]
C          G/B                Am7  G/B
 I took my love and I took it down
C            G/B                    Am7   G/B
 I climbed a mountain and I turned around
      C        G/B             Am7          G/B
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G/B        Am7
Till the landslide brought me down
 
[Verse]
G/B C             G/B         Am7   G/B
Oh, mirror in the sky what is love
        C               G/B         Am7   G/B
Can the child within my heart rise above
      C                G/B      Am7   G/B
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
      C          G/B     Am7   G/B  C   G/B   Am7  G/B
Can I handle the seasons of my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
 
[Pre-Chorus]
| C G/B | Am7 D/F# |
   Mmm...
 
[Chorus]
      G          D7/F#    Em
Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I
C        G/B         Am     D/F#
Built my life around you
    G              D7/F#        Em
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
    C           G/B   Am7      G/B
And I'm getting older too
 
[Solo]
| C G/B | Am7 G/B |

| C G/B | Am7   D/F# D7/F# |
 
[Chorus]
      G          D7/F#    Em
Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I
C        G/B         Am     D/F#
Built my life around you
    G              D7/F#        Em
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
    C           G/B   Am7   G/B
And I'm getting older too
    C           G/B   Am7   G/B
Oh, I'm getting older too
 
[Verse]
    C           G/B           Am7   G/B
Ah, ah, take my love, take it down
    C           G/B                 Am7   G/B
Ah, ah, climb a mountain and turn around
           C          G/B           Am7          G/B
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G/B       Am7   G/B
Will the landslide bring you down?
           C        G/B             Am7          G/B
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills...
 
[Outro]
         C         G/B       Am7
Will the landslide bring you down?
 G/B        C         G/B        Am7
Oh, oh, the landslide bring you down?
