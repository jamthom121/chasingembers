[Intro]
C   Em   F   G
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                     Em
I will leave my heart at the door
        F
I won't say a word
        G
They've all been said before, you know
 
   C                 Em
So why don't we just play pretend
               F
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
   G                E       E/Ab
Or scared of having nothing left
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      Am                    C/G
Look, don't get me wrong, I know
                 Dm
There is no tomorrow
Dm7/G
All I ask is
 
 
[Chorus]
C             A7         A7/Db Dm
If this is my last night with  you
F/G              G7        G/B    C
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
          A7      A7/Db Dm
Give me a memory I  can use
F/G            G7
Take me by the hand
G/B      C       G/B    Am
while we do what lovers do
           C/E      Dm7
It matters how this ends
       F/G                   C
'Cause what if I never love again?
 
 
[Interlude]
(C)  Em   F   G
 
 
[Verse 2]
C
I don't need
     Em
Your honesty
             F
It's already in your eyes
        G
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
 
C               Em
No one knows me like you do
                      F
and since you're the only one that mattered
          G           E  E/Ab
tell me, who do I run to?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      Am                    C/G

There is no tomorrow

All I ask is

Take me by the hand
G/B      C       G/B    Am
while we do what lovers do
           C/E      Dm7
It matters how this ends

'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be the way we remember us
