[Intro]
A  Asus4  A  Asus4
 
[Verse 1]
             A                                 E
All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am
        F#m                                  D
So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am
          A                  E                     F#m           D
But these stories don't mean anything, when you've got no one to tell them to
     A     E              A  Asus4 A
It's true, I was made for you
 
[Verse 2]
           A                                  E
I climbed across the mountain tops, swam all across the ocean blue
                  F#m
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
            D
But baby, I broke them all for you
            A           E
Oh, because even when I was flat broke
    F#m                 D                  A
You made me feel like a million bucks, you do
E              A  Asus4 A
I was made for you
 
[Solo]
| A     | A     | E     | E     |
| F#m   | F#m   | D     | D     |
| A     | E     | F#m   | D     |
| A     | E     | A  A4 | A
 
[Verse 3]
(A)
You see the smile that's on my mouth
                E
It's hiding the words that don't come out
           F#m
All of our friends who think that I'm blessed
           D
They don't know my head's a mess
    A                   E
No, they don't know who I really am
    F#m                  D                          A
And they don't know what I've been through like you do
    E              A  Asus4 A
And I was made for you
 
[Verse 4]
             A                                 E
All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am
        F#m                                  D
So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am
              A                  E
Oh, but these stories don't mean anything
            F#m           D
When you've got no one to tell them to
     A     E              A  Asus4 A
It's true, I was made for you
                    A         E              A  Asus4  A
Oh yeah, well, it's true that I was made for you
