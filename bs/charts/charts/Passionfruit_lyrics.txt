Lyrics for "Passionfruit" by Drake Paramore



Listen, seeing you got ritualistic
I'm cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

A tension
Between us just like picket fences
Well, you got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on for my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no, no, no

Listen harder buildin' trust from a distance
Well, I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart (Ah, ah)

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no, no, no

I got my eyes on you
You act so different around me
I think there's something
I think there's something, baby
