Lyrics for "Both Sides of the Blade" by Max McNown



What's on your face
Ain't in your heart
We're miles apart
Across this table
Steam rising up
From coffee cups
Four-feet apart
But darling I can't get to you

That flower pot
You went and bought
Has sat there empty now for ages
I don't want safety
Or the silence suffocating
Come back underneath my skin

I wanna feel you again
I just want to need you again
I want my heart to break
Each time you walk away
Give me both sides of the blade

Let me bleed again
I'll die so I can breathe again
Give me beauty give me blame
Give me love and give me pain
Give me both sides of the blade

Tied up in tension
Won't you cut the rope and let me fall back into place with you?
Break me and burn me 'cause the hurt is nothing worse than what indifference can do

I wanna feel you again
I just want to need you again
I want my heart to break
Each time you walk away
Give me both sides of the blade

Let me bleed again
I'll die so I can breathe again
Give me beauty give me blame
Give me love and give me pain
Give me both sides of the blade

Let's let the armor fall
Remind me how to risk it all
The way we used to do
Pick up the sword
'Cause I know what we're fighting for
It's me and you

I wanna feel you again
I just want to need you again
I want my heart to break
Each time you walk away
Give me both sides of the blade

Let me bleed again
I'll die so I can breathe again
Give me beauty give me blame
Give me love and give me pain
Give me both sides of the blade
