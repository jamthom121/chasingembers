[Verse 1]
Cadd9      Em
  Ceilings, plaster
Cadd9            G            D
  Can't you just make it move faster?
Cadd9   Em                 D
  Lovely to be sitting here with you
                          Cadd9   Em
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
Cadd9          G           D
  My shoes are now full of water
Cadd9   Em               D
  Lovely to be rained on with you
                       Cadd9
It's kinda cute but it's
 
[Chorus]
(Cadd9)
So short
                        G
Then you're driving me home
                  D
And I don't wanna leave
                Cadd9
But I have to go
 
You kiss me in your car
       G                         D
And it feels like the start of a movie
         Em
I've seen before
  D
Before
 
[Verse 2]
Cadd9        Em
  Bed sheets, no clothes
Cadd9           G       D
  Touch me like nobody else does
Cadd9   Em               D
  Lovely to just lay here with you
                       Cadd9    Em
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
Cadd9               G         D
  But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Cadd9       B7                 C          D
  Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
 
[Chorus]
Cadd9
  But it's over
                        G
Then you're driving me home
                   D                   Cadd9
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
 
You kiss me in your car
       G                         D
And it feels like the start of a movie
 
I've seen before
 
Cadd9
  But it's not real
                G
And you don't exist
              D                        Cadd9
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
 
It hits me in the car
       G                       D
And it feels like the end of a movie
          Emadd9
I've seen        before
  D
Before
