Lyrics for "Dancing On My Own" by Calum Scott


Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at I bet she's around

And yeah I know it's stupid
But I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh oh oh
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Oh oh oh
And I'm givin' it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line
Stilettos on broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

And I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Ooh
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Ooh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
And I keep dancing on my own
And oh, no

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Oh oh oh
And I keep dancing on my own
And no, no

Said, I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh, no
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Oh, no
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
And I keep dancing on my own

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here
