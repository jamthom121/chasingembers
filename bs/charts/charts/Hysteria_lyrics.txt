Lyrics for "Hysteria" by Def Leppard


Out of touch, out of reach yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shakin' to my knees

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria
Oh can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feelin', better start believin'
'Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near
Out of me, into you yeah
You can hide it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide, that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me

I gotta know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
'Cause it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
'Cause it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

I get hysterical, hysteria
When you get that feeling, you'd better believe it
Better start believing, because it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, oh babe, say you will

Get closer to me, get closer baby
Baby, closer, get closer, closer to me
