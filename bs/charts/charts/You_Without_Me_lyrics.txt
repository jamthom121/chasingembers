Lyrics for "You Without Me" by Brandi Carlile


Was your smile always crooked?
Was the freedom ever free?
Do you kick the rocks between your feet
After all this time with me?

You can listen to your own records now
Decide what you believe
You can pray on stars and skip the gods
Like stones across the sea

But I would know you anywhere
I lost myself in you
Heavy are the hands that you are
Free to slip right through
Do what you have to do

There you are
My morning star
I wondered when you'd show
Give me just a quick thumbs-up
A wink before you go
I never heard that voice before today
I remind myself to breathe
There you are
It's just you
Without me

I'm late to another game
I guess I never learned the rules
I showed up with a broken name
And handed it to you

I'm not sure if you could fix it now
But if you wanted to
I would follow you around
And carry all your tools

I would know you anywhere
I found myself in you
Heavy are the hands that hold the
Changes you'll go through
Do what you have to do

There you are
My morning star
I wondered when you'd show
Give me just a quick thumbs-up
A wink before you go
I never heard that voice before today
I remind myself to breathe
There you are
It's just you
Without me

As predictable as time and age
But comforting in some strange way
Time makes every one of us an absolute cliché
But when I met you face-to-face
None of it was true
So who am I if I'm not you?

There you are
My morning star
I wondered when you'd show
Give me just a quick thumbs-up
A wink before you go
I never heard that voice before today
I remind myself to breathe
I'm ever just a thought away
If ever you need me
You're gonna live a lot of life
You're gonna see a lot of years
God willing
Just you
Without me

There you are
Just you
Without me
Without me
Without me
